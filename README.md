# Clangen++ is currently in development, and supports no game-version! Please be patient, a mod like this just to get up-to-date takes ALOT of time!

*******************************************************************************

# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the mod all about?

**Clangen++** is a rewrite of [Clangen](https://github.com/Thlumyn/clangen) in **C++**, in-order to take advantage of **C++** in game-dev over **Python**! This "mod" currently has no intentions to add any more content than is already existing, but there are plans in the future! The **main goal** we are working towards is getting up to date to **Commit** [90af015cfcee6d5706bc4a01bd8b04a76f72ab34](https://github.com/Thlumyn/clangen/commit/90af015cfcee6d5706bc4a01bd8b04a76f72ab34), and we will let you know when that goal is reached!

### Will it work on my platform?
During development, the primary environment is **Windows 10**, but I do have other systems in mind! I am planning to support **Linux-Based Systems** aswell as **Solaris** and **MacOs**, but they will not be worked on until the initial release of this mod!
If you wish to see the exact details, you go to [here!](#supported-platforms)
### Can I use this mod with other mods?
There is *partial* mod support but only for mods that altar existing assets. This is because any new assets **would have** to be added by changing the game-code and theres no support for that yet. What should work is:
- Any sprite/visual overwrites
- Any sound overwrites (when that feature becomes available)
- Any patrol, event or condition overwrites (they can be additions/deletions aslong as they edit an existing file!)

**I am more than happy (with permission from the owners of course) to make mods compatible with this one!**

# Future Plans
Here are all **MY** future plans, you can suggest any feature you want and I will look over, adding them if I want too **BUT** I will not add them here!
### New Credits Screen
I want to make it so instead of just a wall of scrollable text and names, there is instead a screen with an animated background of stars in the sky! And then (in a sorta constellation-way) there'll be highlighted all-white but transparent icons of every contributer! And if you hover over them, there'll be a physical example of their contributions. If say they contributed only bug-fixes or other purely technical things- **THEN** text will be only thing shown
